# Hash! - BlockchainTechnologies

A repository for a university blockchain technologies course.
This project implements two hashing algorithms: MatrixHash (a custom algorithm created by us)
and VibeHash(an algorithm created using Claude AI).

## MatrixHash

MatrixHash is a hashing algorithm created by us. The main idea was using matrix multiplication to create a hash,
however after a lot of changes, the final algorithm is quite different from the original idea to be more efficient.
Nonetheless, the name related to matrix multiplication has remained. (see old versions of readmes to see the original
idea)

Detailed description of algorithm:
We initialize an integer array of size 64 and a oneSum with a starting value of 0
We iterate through each input's char symbol, converting it to an bit representation (e.g. if we encounter 'a' symbol we
would convert it to 01100001)
We iterate through each bit of this bit representation (0 or 1). We also calculate the index, which is calculated by (
char's index * 8 + bit's index) mod 64; this way index will stay between 0 and 63, no matter the input's length. This
index will be used to add different values to the corresponding hash array element. We will also keep track of the
amount of 1s in the bit representation of input using the oneSum variable.
If the bit that we were iterating on was 1, we add 1 to the hash[index]. Else, If that bit was 0 and the current hash
index is more than 0, we perform hash[index] += hash[index - 1]. Finally, if index is 0, we perform this operation:
hash[0] += hash[input.size % 64] + oneSum. No matter the scenario, then we will add to the corresponding hash element
bit value multiplied by the sum of current char's index, current bit's index and oneSum mod 64.
After finishing iterating through input, we start to iterate through each element of the hash array itself. Then we
while iterating through its bits we apply same processes as defined previously, except the last step. Finally we convert
each element inside the hash array into hexadecimal by applying modulo 16 to it and choosing corresponding hexadecimal
symbol.

### Strenghts of the algorithm:

- Deterministic
- Output is always the same size (64 hex chars)
- Avalanche effect (average hex-wise similarity between hashes of inputs with a 1 char difference char is ~7%)
- Low collision rate
- Faster than VibeHash

### Weaknesses of the algorithm:

- Slower than SHA256 and MD5

### Benchmarks (HashTests with 100k):

It can be observed, that when input gets exponentially larger, hash takes exponentially more time. Thus it proves that
our hash's time complexity is O(n)=n (linear)

## VibeHash

VibeHash is a hashing algorithm created with Claude AI.

- We will not go in depth explaining the algorithm, but you can see
  the [chats here](https://claude.ai/share/1ce99725-f78d-4212-9ac7-555b50029023) (the issues we faced were later fixed
  by us)

### Strenghts of the algorithm:

- Deterministic
- Output is always the same size (64 hex chars)
- Avalanche effect (average hex-wise similarity between hashes of inputs with a 1 char difference char
- Low collision rate (no found in the tests done)

### Weaknesses of the algorithm:

- Slower than MatrixHash, SHA256 and MD5
- i have no clue how it works

We can observe that while vibe hash's performance was a bit slower than our hash's, it still exhibits linear time
complexion.

## SHA256 and MD5

SHA256 and MD5 are widely used hashing functions. Famously, SHA256 is used as a proof of work in bitcoin's blockhain.

# Setup guides

Note: if you plan on testing the application (-t), please put [konstitucija.txt](https://bit.ly/33nYy2v) in the
data/input/test directory

Linux setup guide:

1. Install git
   and [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Install g++, CMake and OpenSSL (may have to google the name, on some platforms it's called libssl-dev)[1] using your
   package manager, e.g. for arch linux `sudo pacman -S gcc cmake openssl openmp`
3. Open your terminal emulator in the repository folder
4. Build the project `cmake -B build -S .; cmake --build build` (if you get errors, you may need to specify -G "Unix
   Makefiles")
5. Navigate to /bin/ directory
6. Run ./BlockchainTechnologies. You may need to use the -h flag to see the usage instructions.

SETUP GUIDE for Windows users

1. Install git
   and [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Install the [MSYS2 environment](https://www.msys2.org/)
3. After setting up open the MSYS2 mingw64 bash terminal (not the plain msys2)
4. navigate to the project folder where this repository is cloned
5. Install the g++ compiler, cmake and OpenSSL[1] for the environment:
   `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-openmp`
6. Build the project `cmake -B build -S .; cmake --build build`
7. Navigate to /bin/ directory
8. Run ./BlockchainTechnologies. You may need to use the -h flag to see the usage instructions.

[1]: OpenSSL is only used for testing our algorithms with other popular hashing algorithms(sha256 and md5).
If you don't want to install it - comment out everything in OtherAlgorithms.h, all lines related to sha256 and md5 in
CliArgHandler and find_package(OpenSSL ...) as well as target_link_libraries (... OpenSSL ...) in CMakeLists.txt.
Then the application should build without having to install OpenSSL.
